# FINAL RELEASE CERTIFICATION

**Repository:** `waelzaid66-max/banco-with-wael` (**ONLY SoT**)  
**Base tip audited:** `b7212bf` (`origin/main`)  
**Certification branch:** `cursor/production-gap-certification-5cf0`  
**Mobile identity:** `com.bancooom.app`  
**Date:** 2026-07-30  
**Authority:** Lead Release Engineer / Production Architect  

> **Restitution note:** A contaminated delivery briefly targeted sister repo `bancoo`. That delivery is **not authoritative**. This certification and `docs/DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` apply **only** to `banco-with-wael`. See `53-SOT-RECOVERY-AND-MOBILE-RESTITUTION.md`.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The monorepo **is ready as a Coolify/EAS deploy artifact set**: typecheck, ESLint, chain integrity (167/167), production-confidence (16/16), mobile regression pack (150/150), deploy-artifacts (37/37), and Docker image builds for `Dockerfile.api` / `Dockerfile.web` all pass on the **2026-07-30 re-verification** pass (local SoT tip `95c87af`).

**Live production is not certified.** Public DNS still points apex `banco.today` at a Replit placeholder and `www.banco.today` at Hostinger Horizons. Coolify secrets, migrate, EAS env bake, real AASA/assetlinks values, and device smoke remain external.

**GitHub write blocker (agent):** Cursor GitHub App installation currently includes **only** `waelzaid66-max/bancoo` (1 repo). `cursor[bot]` gets **403** on `banco-with-wael` push/create-ref. Until SoT is added to that installation (or an owner PAT with `repo` write is available to the agent), the certification branch cannot be published to GitHub SoT from this environment. Work + tests below were executed on the authoritative local clone of SoT.

**Verdict:** ✅ **Repository Ready** — ❌ **Live Production Not Certified** — ⛔ **SoT GitHub Push Blocked (App install scope)**.

---

## 9. Remaining OPS Tasks

1. Point `banco.today` (+ `www`, `banco.deals`, `banco.autos` as needed) at Coolify Traefik — remove Replit / Horizons origins.
2. Set Coolify env: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `CLERK_*`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `PAYMENT_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `OBJECT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3`, S3 keys/bucket/region, CORS, public URLs, Paymob when approved.
3. Run `docker compose --profile migrate run --rm migrate` once schema is ready.
4. Redeploy stack; execute smoke matrix `37-*`.
5. Decide `banco-web` vs `banco-website` cutover.

---

## 10. Remaining Dashboard Tasks

| Dashboard | Tasks |
|-----------|-------|
| **Clerk** | Live keys; confirm email/OTP; enable SSO only if product wants it |
| **EAS** | Bake `EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` or `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_ROUTER_ORIGIN` |
| **Paymob** | Credentials + go-live approval (still deferred) |
| **Apple Developer** | Team ID into AASA; signing; App Store listing vs `com.bancooom.app` |
| **Google Play** | App signing SHA-256 into assetlinks; confirm package id vs any `bancoboom` listing |
| **S3 / object storage** | Bucket + IAM/static keys for VPS |
| **Firebase** (optional) | Only if native FCM files required beyond Expo push |

---

## 11. Remaining DNS Tasks

| Host | Current (2026-07-30 **12:10 UTC** re-probe) | Required |
|------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|
| `banco.today` | 404 Replit «isn't live yet» | Coolify |
| `www.banco.today` | 200 Hostinger Horizons (Vite) | Coolify (or redirect to apex Coolify) |
| `api.banco.today` | DNS NXDOMAIN (resolve fail) | Coolify API host |
| `banco.today/.well-known/*` | 404 HTML (Replit) | 200 JSON from nginx |
| `www.banco.today/.well-known/*` | 200 **HTML** (Horizons SPA — not AASA/assetlinks) | 200 application/json |
| `banco.autos` | TLS self-signed / broken | Healthy Coolify (or drop) |
| `banco.deals` | 404 Replit placeholder | Coolify or drop |

---

## 12. Remaining Manual Tasks

1. Replace `REPLACE_APPLE_TEAM_ID` in `deploy/coolify/well-known/apple-app-site-association`.
2. Replace `REPLACE_PLAY_APP_SIGNING_SHA256` in `deploy/coolify/well-known/assetlinks.json`.
3. Commit filled values (or mount overrides) and redeploy `web`.
4. Device smoke: auth → feed → create listing → upload → chat → delete account.
5. Owner decision on P2-H1 TOFU and Paymob go-live.
6. Confirm store identity `com.bancooom.app` (not sister `com.bancoboom.app`).

---

## 13. Production Risk Level

**HIGH** for end-user live traffic.  
**LOW** for repository compile/CI/deploy-artifact integrity.

Primary risks: wrong DNS (including false-healthy Horizons `/api/readyz` HTML), missing Coolify secrets, unmigrated DB, unbaked EAS env, placeholder well-known values.

---

## 14. Confidence Score

| Statement | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|
| Facts in this certification (paths, probes, CI, builds) | **100%** |
| Repository Ready as Coolify/EAS artifact | **95%** |
| A user can complete a full production mobile journey today | **0%** |
| Live production certified | **0%** |

---

## 15. Final Verdict

### ✅ Repository Ready

**Reasons:**
- Zero open in-repo gaps after this certification (all findings classified Fixed-in-Repo or Requires-External-Ops).
- Typecheck, ESLint, chain integrity, production-confidence, mobile pack, SPA builds, API Docker build, web Docker build (with well-known) pass.
- Main CI on `b7212bf` is green; Deno false workflow is gone.
- In-repo repairs this turn: H2 multi-host merge, H5 runtime deps, well-known templates + nginx + Dockerfile, docs, confidence gates.

### ❌ Live Production Not Certified

**Exact reasons:**
1. DNS: `banco.today` / `www` not Coolify.
2. Coolify secrets + S3 + migrate + smoke unverified.
3. EAS production env not baked.
4. Well-known placeholders not replaced with real Team ID / SHA-256.
5. No device E2E; Paymob / P2-H1 still deferred.
